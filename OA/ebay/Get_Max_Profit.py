First, I wanna know how much money I could have made yesterday if I'd been trading Apple stocks all day.

So I grabbed Apple's stock prices from yesterday and put them in a list called stock_prices, where:

The indices are the time (in minutes) past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
The values are the price (in US dollars) of one share of Apple stock at that time.
So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, that means stock_prices[60] = 500.

Write an efficient function that takes stock_prices and returns the best profit I could have made from one purchase and one sale of one share of Apple stock yesterday.


  stock_prices = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]

get_max_profit(stock_prices)
# Returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)

#brute force O(n^2)
#The brute force â†´ approach would be to try every pair of times (treating the earlier time as the buy time and the later time as the sell time) and see which one is higher.
def get_max_profit1(stock_prices):
    max_profit = 0

    # Go through every time
    for outer_time in range(len(stock_prices)):

        # For every time, go through every other time
        for inner_time in range(len(stock_prices)):
            # For each pair, find the earlier and later times
            earlier_time = min(outer_time, inner_time)
            later_time   = max(outer_time, inner_time)

            # And use those to find the earlier and later prices
            earlier_price = stock_prices[earlier_time]
            later_price   = stock_prices[later_time]

            # See what our profit would be if we bought at the
            # earlier price and sold at the later price
            potential_profit = later_price - earlier_price

            # Update max_profit if we can do better
            max_profit = max(max_profit, potential_profit)

    return max_profit


#O(n) O(1)
'''
For every price, we check if:

we can get a better profit by buying at min_price and selling at the current_price
we have a new min_price
To start, we initialize:

min_price as the first price of the day
max_profit as the first profit we could get
We decided to return a negative profit if the price decreases all day and we can't make any money. We could have raised an exception 
instead, but returning the negative profit is cleaner, makes our function less opinionated, and ensures we don't lose information.
