1. Understand the problem and Define Design Scope ( 11- 15 minutes)
   Specific Features ( max 4 features)

   Practical Estimates (numerical)( Users, resources etc)

   Tech Stack

   Scaling requirements ( say for x months)

2. Discuss High level Design, trade offs and take feedback from interviewer ( 15 minutes)
   Basic Blueprint

   Key Resources and services

   Use cases

   Feedback from the interviewer

3. Go in depth of the proposed solution — high level coding( 15 minutes)
   Identify important components in the proposed architecture

   Resources and scaling estimations ( calculations to meet the scaling requirements)

   API Design

   Database schema

4. Discuss the bottle necks, refinements, improvements etc ( 7–10 minutes)
   System Bottlenecks and failure/error points

   Operational metrics and issues

   Refinements

   Future of your proposed solution
